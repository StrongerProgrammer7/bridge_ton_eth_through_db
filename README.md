<h1>Bridge TON - ETH through DB</h1>

<h3 align="center"> Brief introduction </h3>
 <p>The main goal of the work is to create a bridge between ETH & TON smart contracts through a database. This will increase work flexibility by allowing patients and doctors to use different wallets.<br><br>
The scientific novelty of the paper is that a new approach to patient-physician interaction through the use of different wallets is proposed.</p>
    <h4 align="center">Blockchain in healthcare</h4>
    <p align="justify">Blockchain allows you to create a distributed database that is protected from unauthorized access and manipulation.</p>
    <h4 align="center">Smart Contract in healthcare</h4>
    <p align="justify">Different smart contracts can be used in medicine to improve the security and efficiency of medical data processing, manage medical supplies, and automate many of the processes associated with medical services. </p>
     <h4 align="center">Problem blockchain and accept DB/IPFS</h4>
    <p align="justify">It takes a lot of money to store a huge number of records on the blockchain, and the authorized exchange of medical records is another problem. The proposed system uses the Interplanetary File System (IPFS) and a database to overcome this problem.
<br>The database or IPFS and smart contracts can be used to optimize the process of interaction between the doctor and the patient. Below are some possible ways to use the database and smart contracts:
<ul>
  <li>Appointment appointment: The doctor can create an appointment in the database, specifying the date and time of the appointment, as well as information about the patient. A smart contract can automatically send an appointment confirmation to a patient.</li>
  <li>Storage of medical data: The database can be used to store the medical data of patients, such as test results, diagnoses, previous appointments, etc. A smart contract can ensure the security and confidentiality of these data.</li>
  <li>Issuing prescriptions: The doctor can create a prescription in the database, specifying the necessary medicines and dosages. A smart contract can automatically send a prescription to a pharmacy for execution</li>
  <li>Assignment of tests: The doctor can create an appointment for tests in the database, indicating the necessary studies and deadlines. A smart contract can automatically send an assignment to a lab for execution.</li>
  <li>Doctor-Patient Information Sharing: The system can be used to share information between doctor and patient, such as sending appointment notifications or communicating when questions arise.</li>
  <li>Both patients and doctors can interact with each other using different wallets (TON & ETH in this work)</li>
 </ul>

<h3 align="center">Development tools and Programming Language</h3>
<p align="justify"> For Smart Contract, i used Solidity and IDE Remix(Debug contract) for ETH and TACT for TON, also Personal Blockchain Ganache</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>Inside our server, server-ganache is enabled. And the smart contract is deployed inside server-ganahce</strong></p>
<p align="justify"> For Web-Site, used React and NodeJS</p>
<p><b>Node v18.13.0 ,<br>npm v8.19.3</b></p>
